## About The Project

![Pendulum Simulation Screen Shot](images/Screenshot.png)

The goal of this project was to create an accurate pendulum simulation. I do this by using different equations to calculate the position of the pendulum. \
\
I started this project at high school with my physics teacher, who also provided me the equations for the pendulum.
